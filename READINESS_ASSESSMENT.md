### 🟡 **RECOMMENDED** (Should Fix for Professional Polish)

1. **Replace Placeholder Images** 🖼️
   - **Current Status:** Using generic placeholder images
   - **Files to Replace:**
     - `profile-placeholder.jpg` → Your professional headshot (300x300px recommended)
     - `project1-placeholder.jpg` → Text Summarization project screenshot
     - `project2-placeholder.jpg` → ATS Resume Checker screenshot
     - `project3-placeholder.jpg` → Marks Prediction project screenshot
   - **Impact:** Medium - Images make the portfolio more personal and professional
   - **How to Fix:** Take screenshots of your projects and replace the files

2. **Verify All External Links** 🔗
