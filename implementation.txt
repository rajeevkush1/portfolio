This is a great request! I will synthesize the content for your portfolio blueprint (**RAJEEV KUSHWAHA**) using the information I could gather from your provided links (GitHub, LinkedIn, Kaggle) to maximize its impact for ML/AI/DL internships.

Since direct, real-time fetching of all your personal project and certification details is constrained by the search tool, I will use the available information to **structure your data and fill in placeholder details with assumptions based on typical ML portfolios** and the initial search results. **You must verify and replace the bracketed placeholders `[ ]` with your precise details.**
